We are refining the Muloo homepage again.

IMPORTANT:
Do NOT change the hero section.
Do NOT change hero layout, typography, badge animation, or right-side capability cards.
Hero is final.

All refinements apply to sections below the hero only.

----------------------------------------------------
HEADER REFINEMENT
----------------------------------------------------

1. Increase logo size by approximately 20%.
2. Increase navigation font size by 3px.
3. Increase spacing between navigation items slightly.
4. Maintain current color system and structure.

----------------------------------------------------
ADD NEW SECTION AFTER HERO
----------------------------------------------------

Add a new section directly below the hero:

Headline:
"If any of this sounds familiar…"

Add 4 pain-point cards with short sharp copy:

• HubSpot feels messy and unreliable.
• Systems don’t talk to each other.
• Reporting lacks clarity.
• AI feels exciting but unclear how to apply.

Keep styling consistent with dark theme.
Use subtle card borders and light hover effects.
Do not overuse accent colours here.

----------------------------------------------------
FOUR STREAMS SECTION
----------------------------------------------------

1. Fix routing so clicking “Explore” scrolls to the top of each service page, not the middle.
2. Slightly increase hover glow per stream colour (subtle only).
3. Maintain current card layout and structure.

----------------------------------------------------
TRUSTED ECOSYSTEM SECTION
----------------------------------------------------

1. Increase primary platform logos by 35%.
2. Improve spacing between logo rows.
3. Add short intro line above logos:
   "We work with the platforms your business already depends on."
4. Keep grayscale logos.
5. On hover, apply subtle teal glow.

Affiliate readiness:
Make all ecosystem tags clickable links with placeholder href="#".
They must open in new tab.
Maintain tag design.

----------------------------------------------------
ADD LEAD MAGNET SECTION
----------------------------------------------------

Insert new section before Outcomes section:

Title:
"Free HubSpot & Systems Health Check"

Body:
"Get the 10-point checklist we use to stabilise CRM, integrations, and reporting foundations."

Add CTA button:
"Download the checklist"

Button should trigger modal placeholder with email input field.
No backend required.

Design:
Dark section.
Subtle radial teal glow.
Premium, minimal.

----------------------------------------------------
CERTIFICATIONS SECTION REFINEMENT
----------------------------------------------------

Refactor certification badge layout:

1. Align badges in clean structured grid.
2. Reduce visual clutter.
3. Add small heading above:
   "Certified & Accredited"
4. Maintain current badge assets.

----------------------------------------------------
OUTCOMES & TESTIMONIALS
----------------------------------------------------

1. Keep current structure.
2. Improve spacing and alignment.
3. Reduce excessive empty vertical padding.
4. Keep tone premium and restrained.

----------------------------------------------------
