Busy being busy

## There's plenty of activity, but not enough movement on the numbers.

We hear this so often. Your teams work hard but pipeline, conversion, revenue or CSAT scores just aren’t moving fast enough. The challenge is that we live in a time of unprecedented digital change. Tools don’t talk to each other, user and customer journeys feel disjointed, and you’re buying agency hours without clear impact. You’re not short of effort, you’re short of outcomes. Let’s change that.

Outcome‑backed commitments



Help starts here

## We turn software + business processes into measurable outcomes.

We blend three things so you move from activity to impact, faster and more predictably.

![icon-green-secure](https://www.struto.io/hubfs/struto-2025/icon-green-secure.svg)

### People

Strategic, advisory and tactical delivery experts who align work to your business outcomes and revenue goals.

![icon-green-secure](https://www.struto.io/hubfs/struto-2025/icon-green-secure.svg)

### Process

A shared outcomes roadmap, robust enough to de-risk the agreed outcomes and flexible enough to adapt.

![icon-green-secure](https://www.struto.io/hubfs/struto-2025/icon-green-secure.svg)

### Platform

The strutoIX Outcomes Engine connects HubSpot with your tech stack and turns key signals into coordinated service actions.

How we do it

## Two approaches. One promise: predictable business outcomes.

We'll help you choose what fits today. Switch or blend as you scale.

### Platform-powered Outcomes

When outcomes rely on multiple systems, strutoIX AI Agents orchestrates actions across your stack with HubSpot in the loop. Add strutoUX to create better in‑HubSpot user experiences, strutoCX to create better connected on-HubSpot customer experiences, and strutoAI for assistants. You scale what works without adding overhead.

1. Agree the Outcomes Roadmap
2. Configure the engine and Outcome Packs
3. Measure and scale

## The Promise. The Engine. The Model.

![icon-green-chart](https://www.struto.io/hubfs/struto-2025/icon-green-chart.svg)

### Outcomes‑as‑a‑Service   (OaaS):

Buy a defined business outcome. Think of outcomes as the key result in your OKRs (Objectives and Key Results), such as increasing efficiency, reducing churn or accelerating pipeline.

![icon-green-ai](https://www.struto.io/hubfs/struto-2025/icon-green-ai.svg)

### Outcomes-as-an-Agentic Solution   (OaAS):

AI agents in the strutoIX Outcomes Engine detect important signals and trigger the next best action across your tools, learning and suggesting improvements.

![icon-green-cmd](https://www.struto.io/hubfs/struto-2025/icon-green-cmd.svg)

### Service‑as‑Software   (SaS):

Predictable subscription for a curated service stack. We manage changing tech; you pay for successful outcomes, with guided services when you need them.

## Outcomes our customers achieved

### Higher on‑site conversion from connected, conversion‑ready experiences

### Faster pipeline velocity with cleaner, enriched data and automated plays

### Lower service load through proactive workflows and self‑serve content
