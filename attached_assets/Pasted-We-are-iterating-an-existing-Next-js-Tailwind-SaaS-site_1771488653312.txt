We are iterating an existing Next.js + Tailwind SaaS site for Muloo.

Muloo is a Cape Town based technical partner delivering globally.

The site should be inspired by the structure and tone of https://struto.io — clean, modern, modular, and confidence-focused.

Muloo’s offerings are:
1) Muloo Hub – HubSpot system mastery (implementation, onboarding, optimisation, UI improvements)
2) Muloo Build – integrations, middleware, client portals, authenticated experiences, API-centric engineering
3) Muloo Product – Muloo owned product and SaaS builds
4) Muloo AI – AI workbench services including Codex dev agents, rapid prototypes, vibe coding, AI service agents, AI bug/security services

Do NOT position Muloo as a marketing execution agency. Instead position it as:
- technical partner
- engineering focused
- HubSpot + software + AI

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS
- Keep Tailwind CSS, Next.js with TypeScript.
- Use modular sections (components/sections).
- Integrate a modern structured gradient system:
   • Muloo Core Gradient (navy → deep → teal)
   • Teal Soft Gradient (light background)
   • Technical accent glow
   • HubSpot accent gradient (orange → warm)
- Controlled gradients should enhance focus zones but never overwhelm text.

SITE STRUCTURE
- Home
- Services + 4 detail pages
- Resources (Case Studies + Insights)
- About
- Contact

VISUAL DIRECTION
• Strong typography — bold headings, clear spacing
• Modern SaaS feel, lighter whitespace
• Visual code language (monospace snippets for technical features)
• Simple, consistent iconography
• Subtle hover interactions

CONTENT GUIDELINES
• Use the current copy from the existing build but refresh it for technical clarity
• Introduce AI service language on the homepage and on the new /services/ai page
• Replace any marketing execution terms with technical delivery language

DELIVERABLES
- Updated Next.js project
- Improved responsive design
- Gradient system in Tailwind theme
- Clean modular sections
- A README explaining how the layout can be converted to a HubSpot CMS theme

Make the site feel like it has real product depth, engineering credibility, and strategic AI capability.
